# FlappyQuest - Mixed Reality

Welcome to FlappyQuest, an app that brings the classic game Flappy Bird into the world of mixed reality, thanks to Quest 3.

## Description
FlappyQuest allows you to have a 3D miniature replica of the Flappy Bird video game within your room.

## Disclaimer
The app is still a prototype in the embryonic stage and is essentially a project I am developing to become familiar with the Meta XR All-In-One SDK, dedicated to virtual and mixed reality.

## What I plan to do
- Implement a GUI
- Implement a score system
- Give the player the ability to resize the world
- Implement hand tracking controllers
- Fix the normals of the 3D models
